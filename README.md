# Modified Cookie Clicker Bot

Cookie Clicker is a popular online game focused on students. This game requires users to perform repetitive clicks on the cookie which is an icon in the game that collects points from those clicks. Subsequently, those points are used for buying various available accessories and thus improving your progress in the game. However, these repetitive clicks create inconvenience due to the repetition cumbersome process of performing repetitive task of clicking for collecting points. This in turn affects the popularity of the game as the whole point of the game is to provide is to have points to buy accessories. Our work has implemented an AI based bot towards not only replacing the repetitive clicks but also collecting optimum relevant accessories based on the acquired points. A greedy-based approach is used for choosing optimum accessories as well as filtering out the overpriced accessories.
